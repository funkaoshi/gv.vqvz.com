This is a simple [Sinatra][1] backed web-app to view groups on Flickr. It 
doesn't do much beyond that. It's like Flickr River, only simpler/lamer. It 
might be a good example of how to get going with Sinatra. Sinatra is vendor'd 
here for the time being, since the application is built using the 1.0 code 
base.  [I'm also using the paging_keys.js written by hiddenloop.][2] There is 
some code in the repo I use to run this on Dreamhost.
